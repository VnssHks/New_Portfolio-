          <h2>What belongs together, torn apart</h2>
          <p>This project was created as part of the Creative Map Design Class at TU Vienna.</p>
          <p>We were totally free in chosing topic, size, etc. of the map. So, since I grew up in Berlin - a city which displays its sometimes heavy history on the forefront of most building - I decided it would be a great opportunity to spend some time researching and visualizing some of the most extraordinary ways, people fled the GDR.</p>
       <p>The project, "What Belongs Together, Torn Apart," began with extensive research into both successful and unsuccessful attempts to flee the GDR. Our goal was to include not only famous escapes but also lesser-known stories. This initial phase included gathering statistics and identifying key figures, such as the first documented person to attempt to flee the GDR.

        </p><p>After selecting 10-15 compelling stories, I moved on to the design phase. Early drafts helped determine the placement of each story, ensuring a balanced distribution on the map. This process led to the final selection of 10 stories. Each story was accompanied by an illustration, a brief description, a year, and a location. Given the nature of escapes, I chose to represent the routes with imprecise arrows instead of exact paths to better capture the essence of these journeys.
        
        </p><p>Once the illustrations and descriptions were completed, I began placing them on the map. Due to a tight semester schedule with multiple deadlines, the map's final version was rushed. A last-minute decision to convert the map to black and white led to issues, such as the illegibility of smaller inset maps in the Berlin region.
        
        Growing up in Berlin, this project was particularly meaningful to me. It taught me valuable lessons in map design, especially the importance of avoiding last-minute changes. In the future, I aim to revisit and refine the map, addressing the minor issues and potentially publishing it.</p>
