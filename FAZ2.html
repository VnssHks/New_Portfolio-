          <h2>Es zieht uns den Boden unter den Füßen weg - "It pulls the rug out from under our feet"</h2>
          <p>This is an article that was published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung as part of my Google News Fellowship there. The article is about the situation of soil in Germany. We owe vital products, as well as dispensable consumer goods such as beer and wine, to an important resource: the soil. If it is healthy and rich in nutrients, farmers can produce high-quality yields. However, it is now becoming increasingly common for soils to be diseased. Erosion is increasing, wind and water are carrying away the fertile soil. What remains is barren land that is lost for cultivation.  
            </p>
            <p>The article is comprised of extensive research into Germany's soils and solutions to the very apparent problem of soil degradation. Additionally, two expert interviews with Scientist from Canada and Germany were conducted to produce a high-quality article that is based on scientific facts. To round up the article, which is split into three sections: "What is the problem?", "Why do we have this problem?", and "How can we stop the degradation or even reverse it?", illustrations and visualizations help the reader understand the somewhat complicated parts of the article.
